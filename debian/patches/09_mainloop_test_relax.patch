Subject: [PATCH] Relax /mainloop/timeouts test

On slower architectures like ARM, tests insistently fail with

  test_timeouts: assertion failed (a >= 9): (8 >= 9)
  test_timeouts: assertion failed (b == 4): (3 == 4)

Relax the required minimum loop runs.

Note that this should not necessarily go upstream, on fast/unloaded build
machines it is better to test for the more exact numbers.
